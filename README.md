## Project Descriptions
- **Task 1: [Personal Website]** - "For my first internship task at Tech-A-Intern, I had the opportunity to create my own personal website using HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to dive into the world of web development, where I designed and coded a website that reflects my personality and showcases my interests and accomplishments."

- **Task 2: [Recipe Page]** - "For my second internship task at Tech-A-Intern, I undertook the challenge of creating a recipe page. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development by applying the skills I had acquired in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a practical context."

- **Task 3: [Image Slider]** - "I designed an interactive image slideshow that not only showcased my creativity but also tested my ability to handle user interface interactivity. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in manipulating and animating images, improving my skills in front-end web development."
